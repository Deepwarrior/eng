People always want to be safe. They say so. But at the same time, you can see how people sacrifice their safety for the sake of more "important" things.
People sacrifice safety because safety is slow. Knowledge about numerous traffic accidents is ignored, people continue to take risks and drive their cars. Just because the car is faster than public transport.
People sacrifice safety because safety is more expensive. People can choose an airline company with good planes, but many of them continue to fly with low-cost airlines.
People sacrifice safety because safety is inconvenient. The four digits of the bank card pin are easily threatened by shoulder surfing. In a good way, the pin code should contain the 20-30 digits and then you can not worry about the theft. But how many people will then use that cards?
People sacrifice safety because they cannot properly evaluate it. What is safer: to ride two two kilometers on a bicycle or roller skate? If you would look for answers to all such questions, then you probably wouldn't leave your house at all.
People sacrifice safety because something bad will happen later. And the benefits can be obtained now.
Then why are all these quarantine measures, airbags, complex passwords used if people are still willing to sacrifice them? In my opinion people do not need real safety, but only faith in safety. And all additional actions are needed to strengthen this faith. Safety is also improved, but this can be considered just as a side effect.
